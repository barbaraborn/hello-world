# hello-world
This is the first time I am trying using github. 
Hello, my name is Barbara Born. I am a first year PhD student at the Graduate school of education. 
I am taking this experimental design course in the Psych department because I want to understand more
about experimental design so I can do better research. My main area of interest is teacher education.
